 This repo contains code and data for the first PCA attempt with
 the activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)
 This paper/data can be accessed here: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1874391912005428#ec0005
 HOWEVER, the supplemental table 2 (used in this analysis)
 is only downloadable as a PDF from the publisher and
 requires extensive clean up to be used.
 For this reason the original data table is located
 in this repo titled "activated_PBMC.xlsx"

 The code used for PCA analysis is similar to the above
 but columns not needed for this initial analysis were removed,
 this file is titled "activated_PBMC_trimmed.xlsx"
